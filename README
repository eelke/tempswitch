-- TemperatureSwitch app, based on PT100 / Arduino --
-- Code: eelke.net --


# Set up the Arduino

Change these values:

```
float rangeLowerEdge = 0.0f;  ==> your lower edge
float rangeUpperEdge = 0.0f; ==> your upper edge
bool rangeHasBeenSet = false; ==> true
```

The relay will turn ON whenever the temperature has reached the UPPER edge (or above)
And it will turn OFF whenever the temparature has reached the BOTTOM edge (or below)


# Set up the server (node app)

1. Run:
> $ node server.js
This will start the server and load a browser window

2. Use PM2 to keep the Node.js process running..

# Note 
The Arduino code will run regardless of a serial connection.
The Node app is just to monitor & log its behaviour
